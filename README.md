# Image Processing: Histogram Manipulation, Moving and Rotating
In this notebook there are histogram manipulation alongside moving and rotating an image.
In this project I demonstrate how to do all of the above by taking the theoretical knowledge of image proccessing and applying it using numpy and openCV libraries.
To be expected are histogram equalization per selected area, fourier transformation and a rotation matrix.
The images are given together with the notebook however the code expects them to be read from a folder above, so either edit the code before use or put them
in a folder above as expected.
